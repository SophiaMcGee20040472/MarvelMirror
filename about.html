       <h2>General Instructions for set up and use: </h2>
       
<p>
  Firstly Download Vs code or any other coding application that allows remote access.
When this is completed. We will need to locate the ip address of your raspberry pi, you can do this by using sudo nmap -sn <enteryourIPaddress> in a terminal. I chose to use the virtualbox terminal to do this. 
Once the IP address is found you can ssh in Vs Code you will firstly have to install two ssh extensions. Then in the bottom left corner you will see a small box with symbols similar to >< if you click on this a small text entry box will appear top of the middle of the page. You will then need to write ssh pi@[raspberrypi_ip_address]
It will then ask you to enter your Raspberrypi password. 
</p>
<p>
This was the hard part. Hopefully this will be the easier part.
Once you have completed these steps open the pi folder and click on terminal new. Once this is open I want you to enter cd MarvelMirror Press Enter and then ./Menu.sh and Press Enter.
This will show you a bash script menu in your terminal you can choose 1 to run the blynk app or two to quit.
<br>
Bash Script (1) will run livestream and all the buttons on the Blynk app 
<br>
To Turn off Marvel Mirror safely go to file close remote Connection. 
</p>
<h2>
  When Blynk is chosen you can open your app and choose from multiple buttons:
  </h2>
Button 1: Lights on/off a Love Heart has been created as display.
<br>
Button 2: Email, this will take a photo with raspPi Cam and email it to your email address using SMPT.
<br>
<br>
Button 3: Temp Button, This will tell you the temperature just once unless you Press button again.
<br>
<br>
Button 4 : Tweet , This will tweet camera images and whatever you want to write to twitter this has used the tweepy library.
<br>
<br>
Button 5 : Camera, This button will take a photo and send it to the firebase database to be stored.
<br>
<br>
Button 6 : Quote button, these quotes depending on what the current Temperature, Humidity and Pressure sensed by the SenseHat.
<br>
<br>
Button 7 : This Button links to a Glitch App created. This
App was written using some Javascript, html , and css. Imagery has been taken from firebase and displayed on my index page.
Livestream is also an option on this glitch website.
<br>
<br>
Button 8 : Not present in the diagram but button 8 detects motion and then sends a text message using the twilio library.
<br>
<br>
Button 9: Is a photobooth button that takes a photo and sends it to my printer to be printed.
